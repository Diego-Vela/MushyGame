# MushGame Demo
Unity Project 4

## Introduction
MushGame Demo is a top-down RPG game demo designed for windows computers that follows a protagonist as he tries to save his 
village from Demon Slime: Himothy. The objective of the game is to go to the forest with your companions and defeat Himothy 
and his two slime minibosses.

## Controls
The player can control the game through WASD or arrow keys for movement, F for interaction and text 
based controls, and the cursor for various clicking options.

## Environment
The game features two areas; a village and a forest dungeon. The starting area is the village where the player is able to 
interact with various NPCs that will inform the player of the situation and join him for battle. The forest dungeon features
the three slime bosses. The two minibosses are each responsible for a blockade to the final boss and must be defeated to face
the final boss, Himothy.

## Battle
Currently, battle features only three actions; attack, heal self, and run. Attack and healing are based on hidden stats of the
characters. The turns are calculated with a hidden speed stat that increments up to 10000, sorts by overflow, and allows the 
characters and enemies to take turns. Enemy bosses take two actions for every turn.

## Settings and Features
The player is able to save progress, adjust volume, and adjust brightness. Volume and brightness persist while the game lasts 
but will be reset on exit of the game to not leave data on the player's device.

## Next Expansion
The next expansion of the game will feature skills for each character and enemy for a broader range of battle outcomes as well
as improved UI that will display the characters' hidden stats so the player can calculate the turn order of battle.
